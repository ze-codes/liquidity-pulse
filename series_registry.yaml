  WALCL:
    source: FRED
    cadence: weekly
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1e6
    output_scale: 1
    name: Federal Reserve Total Assets
    description: |
      The total value of assets held by the Federal Reserve, including Treasury securities,
      mortgage-backed securities, and loans to banks. This is the broadest measure of the
      Fed's balance sheet size and the ultimate source of base money.
    impact: High — Primary driver of base money. QE expands WALCL (adds liquidity), QT shrinks it (drains).
    interpretation: |
      Expanding balance sheet (WALCL ↑) is supportive for risk assets — implies lower rates,
      abundant liquidity, encourages investment in higher-yield assets. Contracting balance
      sheet (WALCL ↓) is a headwind, tightening financial conditions.

  RESPPLLOPNWW:
    source: FRED
    cadence: weekly
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1e6
    output_scale: 1
    name: Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks
    description: |
      Deposits held by commercial banks at the Federal Reserve (from H.4.1 release).
      This is the most direct measure of aggregate liquidity available to the banking system.
      Reserves are the ultimate settlement asset.
    impact: High — Changes directly impact banks' capacity to lend, absorb Treasury issuance, and make markets.
    interpretation: |
      Rising reserves signal easier funding conditions (supportive for risk assets).
      Falling reserves signal tightening and can become a significant headwind if scarce.

  RRPONTSYD:
    source: FRED
    cadence: daily
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1e9
    output_scale: 1
    name: ON RRP Facility Outstanding
    description: |
      The amount of cash that money market funds (MMFs) and other eligible institutions
      lend to the Fed overnight, earning a fixed rate. Represents liquidity drained from
      the private sector into a safe, cash-equivalent investment.
    impact: High — A high RRP balance means cash is sitting on the sidelines. Declining RRP means cash is being deployed.
    interpretation: |
      Falling RRP balance is supportive for risk assets (cash moving into T-bills, then other assets).
      Rising RRP balance signals risk aversion and drains liquidity from markets.

  TGA:
    source: TREASURY_TGA
    cadence: daily
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1e6
    output_scale: 1
    name: Treasury General Account
    description: |
      The U.S. Treasury's primary checking account held at the Federal Reserve.
      When Treasury collects taxes or issues bonds, TGA rises (drains reserves).
      When Treasury spends (Social Security, etc.), TGA falls (injects cash).
    impact: High — Direct mechanical link to banking system reserves.
    interpretation: |
      Rising TGA is a direct liquidity drain and headwind for risk assets.
      Falling TGA is a liquidity injection and supportive.

  SOFR:
    source: FRED
    cadence: daily
    units: percent
    raw_scale: 1
    output_scale: 1
    name: Secured Overnight Financing Rate
    description: |
      A broad measure of the cost for banks to borrow cash overnight when collateralized
      by Treasury securities. The primary U.S. interest rate benchmark. Its level relative
      to Fed administered rates (like IORB) indicates money market stress.
    impact: Medium — Key indicator of repo market conditions.
    interpretation: |
      If SOFR trades persistently above IORB, it signals stress in the repo market —
      shortage of cash or collateral. This tightness is a headwind for risk assets.

  IORB:
    source: FRED
    cadence: daily
    units: percent
    raw_scale: 1
    output_scale: 1
    name: Interest on Reserve Balances
    description: |
      The interest rate the Fed pays commercial banks for holding reserves.
      Primary tool of monetary policy used to control the federal funds rate.
      Acts as a floor for overnight rates.
    impact: High (as policy tool) — Changes directly reflect Fed policy stance.
    interpretation: |
      The absolute level matters, but spreads of other rates against IORB are more
      telling for liquidity conditions. IORB serves as the benchmark for comparisons.

  DTB3:
    source: FRED
    cadence: daily
    units: percent
    raw_scale: 1
    output_scale: 1
    name: 3-Month Treasury Bill Rate
    description: |
      The yield on 3-month Treasury bills in the secondary market.
      Bill yields relative to RRP rate and IORB drive MMF asset allocation decisions.
    impact: Medium — Drives money market fund allocation between RRP and bills.
    interpretation: |
      When bill yields rise significantly above the RRP rate, MMFs move cash out of RRP
      into T-bills. This "cash off the sidelines" dynamic is supportive for risk assets.

  DTB4WK:
    source: FRED
    cadence: daily
    units: percent
    raw_scale: 1
    output_scale: 1
    name: 4-Week Treasury Bill Rate
    description: |
      The yield on 4-week Treasury bills in the secondary market.
      Shorter duration than DTB3, more sensitive to near-term funding conditions.
    impact: Medium — Another measure of short-term funding costs.
    interpretation: |
      Similar to DTB3 — higher yields relative to administered rates incentivize
      MMFs to deploy cash into bills rather than parking at the RRP facility.

  WSHOSHO:
    source: FRED
    cadence: weekly
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1e6
    output_scale: 1
    name: Fed Treasury Securities Holdings
    description: |
      The Fed's holdings of U.S. Treasury securities from the H.4.1 release.
      Weekly changes reflect the pace of QT (runoff) or QE (purchases).
      This is the mechanical implementation of balance sheet policy.
    impact: High — Runoff at announced caps is a steady, persistent drain on liquidity.
    interpretation: |
      Negative weekly changes (runoff) = headwind. Faster runoff = stronger headwind.
      Slowdown, flat, or positive changes (purchases) are progressively more supportive.

  WSHOMCB:
    source: FRED
    cadence: weekly
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1e6
    output_scale: 1
    name: Fed MBS Holdings
    description: |
      The Fed's holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities from the H.4.1 release.
      Weekly changes reflect QT/QE pace for the MBS portion of the balance sheet.
    impact: High — Part of the QT/QE mechanical liquidity drain/add.
    interpretation: |
      Same as WSHOSHO — negative changes are headwind, positive are supportive.

  UST_REDEMPTIONS:
    source: TREASURY_REDEMPTIONS
    cadence: daily
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1e6
    output_scale: 1
    name: Treasury Redemptions (Daily)
    description: |
      Daily cash outflows from Treasury as securities mature and are redeemed.
      Includes marketable securities and nonmarketable savings securities.
      Excludes intragovernmental (GAS, FFB, SLGS) which don't inject private sector cash.
    impact: High (supportive) — Redemptions return cash to holders and reduce TGA.
    interpretation: |
      Elevated or clustered redemptions are supportive of liquidity and can offset
      issuance drains around the same window.

  UST_INTEREST:
    source: TREASURY_INTEREST
    cadence: daily
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1e6
    output_scale: 1
    name: Treasury Interest Outlays (Daily)
    description: |
      Daily coupon and interest payments made by Treasury to security holders.
      Direct cash injections from Treasury to the private sector.
    impact: Medium-High (supportive) — Reduces TGA, injects cash.
    interpretation: |
      Higher interest outlays are supportive for liquidity on payment days
      and can cushion issuance-related drains.

  # Treasury Auction Series
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  UST_AUCTION_ISSUES:
    source: TREASURY_AUCTIONS
    cadence: daily
    units: USD
    raw_scale: 1
    output_scale: 1
    name: Treasury Auction Settlements
    description: |
      Using issue_date from auctions API as proxy for settlement timing.
      Sums total_accepted (or offering_amt fallback) by issue_date.
      Tracks realized cash call when auctions complete.
    impact: High (cash drain timing) — Clusters concentrate settlement cash needs.
    interpretation: |
      Spikes flag weeks where Treasury cash calls are lumpy; these can coincide
      with tighter liquidity and risk-off tone.

    output_scale: 1
    name: OFR Treasury Liquidity Stress Index
    description: |
      An index from the Office of Financial Research measuring stress in the
      U.S. Treasury market — the most important market globally. Aggregates
      measures of market functioning (bid-ask spreads, order depth, etc.).
    impact: High (as signal) — Poor Treasury market functioning has spillover effects everywhere.
    interpretation: |
      Rising stress in the Treasury market signals systemic illiquidity
      and is a major headwind for all risk assets.
